# learning-webdev

This repsitory will be a place for me to document my path as I learn to do techncial writing in robotics.

## Background and motivation

### What have I tried?

My intention with this repository is to have a central place to store what I
learn about technical writing. Previously, I have tried several methods of learning and
retaining information. This has included

- Spaced repetition from different sources (Hearing the same content shared by different instructors)
- Reading a lot to get some footing on the basic vocabulary.

The learning curve is still pretty steep.

### What am I trying now?

This repository is an attempt to slow down and meaningfully engage with the
content that I'm learning. In it, I plan to slow down and play with new concepts
as I learn them. Inspired by
[The Feynman Learning Technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/),
I will seek to explain what I am learning here. To play around with ideas, I'll
often make little projects that give me the chance to try something out. Once I
understand it, I'll seek to explain it. If I identify gaps in my knowledge, Ill
dig deeper.

# learning-webdev

This repsitory will be a place for me to document my path as I learn web dev.

## Background and motivation

### What have I tried?

My intention with this repository is to have a central place to store what I
learn about web dev. Previously, I have tried several methods of learning and
retaining information. This has included

- Spaced repetition
- Various tears of note taking
- Reading a lot and only taking the big ideas away

None of these has been particularly satisfactory to me.

I found spaced reptition to be great for remembering facts but not how to apply
concepts. It is also not clear how to make useful cards for programming topics.
Also, it is easy to hide misunderstanding with memorization.

By tears of notetaking, I mean read a book, extract my notes, then gradually
organize and condense those notes. I do like this process. Although, it is not
engaging enough: I read the full book, then look for patterns. I believe to
learn better I should be actively engaging with the content throughout.

Reading a lot was just a waste of time for me. I can read an idea many times
without understanding it or engaging with it in a meaningful way. In the end, I
just end up getting caught up on all the information to memorize without truely
understanding what I'm reading. Needless to say, there are better ways of
learning.

### What am I trying now?

This repository is an attempt to slow down and meaningfully engage with the
content that I'm learning. In it, I plan to slow down and play with new concepts
as I learn them. Inspired by
[The Feynman Learning Technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/),
I will seek to explain what I am learning here. To play around with ideas, I'll
often make little projects that give me the chance to try something out. Once I
understand it, I'll seek to explain it. If I identify gaps in my knowledge, Ill
dig deeper.
